# Correlation-Analysis-with-Python
The Goal of this project is to determine the relationship between the heights and weights of both male and female athletes. 

## Technologies and Tools used:
  Excel: I used excel to clean the columns and to remove all the duplicates
  Python: Used for my data analysis and cleaning
  Jupyter Notebook: An interactive environment for running python code and for documenting my analysis
  
## Result: There's a positive relationship between the height and weight of both male and female athletes i.e the heigher the height, the greater the weight
